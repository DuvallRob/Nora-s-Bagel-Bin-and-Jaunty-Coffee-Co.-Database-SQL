This project is a database design and development project for two local businesses, Nora's Bagel Bin and Jaunty Coffee Co. The goal is to create databases to help these businesses manage their operations.

The project includes the following tasks:

- Designing a normalized physical database model for Nora's Bagel Bin's ordering system
- Using an existing database design document for Jaunty Coffee Co. to create its database
- Loading the tables with sample data and creating a view and an index to protect and improve query performance
- Creating both a simple query and a more complex table joins query to produce meaningful reports from the newly created database.

The project was completed using SQL and a SQL tool (SQL Fiddle) was used to test and run the database application. The results of the SQL scripts were captured in screenshots and compiled into a single PDF file.

The project showcases the following competencies:

- Conceptual Models to Physical Schemas
- Creating Databases
- Creating/Modifying Tables and Views
- Creating Primary Keys/Foreign Keys and Indexes
- Populating Tables
- Creating Simple and Complex Queries

The completed project demonstrates proficiency in these competencies and can be used as a sample project for database design and development work.
